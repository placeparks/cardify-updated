## How to Create These Agents

1. Open Claude Code in your terminal
2. Type `/agent` command
3. Follow the prompts:
   - Step 1: Choose agent type (likely "custom")
   - Step 2: Enter the agent name (e.g., "stripe-integration-agent")
   - Step 3: Copy and paste the description from this file
   - Step 4: Specify which tools if prompted

## Best Practices

- Start with the agents most relevant to your immediate work
- Test each agent after creation with a simple task
- Agents can be modified later if needed
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the agent's purpose
- Include MCP tool specifications for better performance

## Usage Examples

- "Use the stripe-integration-agent to add Apple Pay support"
- "Use the ui-cyberpunk-agent to create a new card selection component"
- "Use the test-quality-agent to add tests for the checkout flow"
