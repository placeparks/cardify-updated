description: Stage, commit, and push all changes to GitHub
---

Stage all changes (including untracked files), create a commit, and push to the current branch on GitHub.

Steps:
1. Run `git status` to see what changes exist
2. Stage all changes with `git add .`
3. Check git status again to confirm staging
4. Create a commit with an appropriate message that summarizes the changes
5. Push to the remote repository with `git push`

Use the Bash tool to execute these git commands. Make sure to write a clear, descriptive commit message that follows the repository's commit message style (based on recent commits).
